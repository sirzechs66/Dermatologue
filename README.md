# Skin Disease Detection using AI at the Edge

Skin Disease Detection at edge predicts the disease of skin from the image of that infected part in less than one second and that's where AI at the Edge come.

This web app simply take a disease image using a web interface and give the disease name with accuracy and time taken for prediction.

## Note:

### This model is not that much accurate. It's only for leaning the deployment of an web app using openvino and flask.
